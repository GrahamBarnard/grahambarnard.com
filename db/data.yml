    - Positives of Blogging
    - ! "<p class=\"p1\">Well hello friends, you guys found me!! Congratulations,
      I wish I could give you some sort of reward like awesome stickers or 10% off
      your next spa but I can only give you a little chat.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p
      class=\"p1\">As I&#39;m starting this new adventure into the blogosphere, I
      wanted to discuss the main reason why I decided to privy everyone with my thoughts
      and feelings. &nbsp;Blogging is going to improve my communication skills, having
      to write down my thoughts has this great little side effect of having to structure
      them in a semi coherent way so that other people can actually understand what
      I&#39;m trying to say.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p
      class=\"p1\">In my experience, it seems that when you&#39;re starting out as
      a developer, your communication skills takes a backseat to being able to build&nbsp;elegant
      functionality. And don&#39;t get me wrong, programming skills are the quintessential
      skill necessary to be a developer, &nbsp;but after working on a few small teams
      you start to understand how communication minimize your costs and creates a
      far far better product.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p
      class=\"p1\">Customer interaction is the simplest example of this, allowing
      vibrant conversation with your customer allows him to explain his needs to you
      and cuts costs by pointing your development team closer to the right direction.
      Listen to the Shop Talk Show podcast, they describe their experience as designers
      leaving customer meetings feeling that &nbsp;&quot;They just don&#39;t understand
      what I am trying to say&quot; which really means &quot;I couldn&#39;t convey
      my thoughts well enough to make him understand me&quot;. &nbsp;This might seem
      like a small deal, but it&#39;s always so difficult on any development project
      to able to grasp the final product that being even 5% closer to the final product
      can remove 5% of incorrect implementation and then additional cost for reimplementation.
      &nbsp;This is an abstract&nbsp;example, but classic computer science books like
      &quot;Mythical Man-Month&quot;, &quot;Code Complete&quot; or any agile book
      contain actual data about this subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p
      class=\"p1\">One of the major concepts in agile development is to have small
      interactions of your product which allows your customer to see the product very
      early on. &nbsp;You are showing your customer a small preview of the product,
      so your customer can tell you how wrong you are and you can fix it.&nbsp;This
      idea is based on the knowledge that the customer does not know what he wants
      and a visual representation will allow him to communicate his actual needs faster
      and allow us to build a better product. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p
      class=\"p1\">In your team, being able to properly communicate with everyone
      just makes life easier. Having your graphic designer explain which exact pixel
      on the 1800px by 2000px screen is wrong, or knowing why your sales guy is mad
      at you for being late on an a fake product that he promised a customer 5 years
      ago, or explaining to your project manager why a simple change is not really
      that simple and is useless. It avoids those &quot;oh shit..&quot; moments when
      your team finishes something and everyone didn&#39;t think about how the legacy
      data was gonna get in.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p
      class=\"p1\">Communication makes you a more valuable member of any team, and
      from the slew of interviews that I have done over the past year, it&#39;s very
      noticeable on first impressions. These companies need to know how I can help
      and why they should sacrifice 2 goats to get me to join their company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p
      class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\">In conclusion, communication
      = good</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Graham</p>\r\n"

    - Why I hate blogging and myself a bit for doing itâ€¦
    - ! "<p>This was the actual first blog post that I wanted to write, but instead
      I started on a positive note so that I didn&#39;t get into a habit of flaming
      things.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But writing negative blog post is so much easier
      and it seems to flow from my fingertips like a oyster crafting this magnificent
      black pearl of destruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height:
      1.6em;\">Okay so blogging, it&#39;s great right? We communicate to an audience
      our personal thoughts about topics and they get to understand our idea and expand
      their own opinions. Everybody wins right? No no nooo, lots of people lose.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span
      style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em;\">The main reason that I don&#39;t
      like blogging is that the majority of blogs lower the quality of the internet.
      Yes, I don&#39;t like blogs because the internet as a whole gets worse. The
      internet is this amazing thing that everybody takes for granted, we abuse it
      and my generation doesn&#39;t really understand how different and better our
      lives are from everyone ever before us. And it&#39;s still so young and blossoming
      into this beautiful flower and I&#39;m so obvious that everyone in the future
      will see this as one the the most important moments in human history. This concept
      of having unlimited information out your fingertips, it&#39;s so unthinkable
      and now commonplace, that you are able to communicate to anyone in the world,
      that you can find information about anything, that you can find direction to
      anywhere. Think about it, really really think about, it&#39;s so amazing, it
      makes me want to cry a bit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px;
      line-height: 1.6em;\">And the reason that I don&#39;t like the majority of blogging
      is that I feel that they have this negative effect on the internet by devaluing
      all the useful information out there. I know this might sound silly because
      I don&#39;t have to follow those people and I can just follow actual useful
      blogs. But because of the mass amount of useless information out there, some
      of it still gets through the cracks and it&#39;s difficult to know what is what.
      Maybe it&#39;s due to great UI/UX design, great marketing skills or some SEO
      magic but I still see it all over the place. It&#39;s like if the internet was
      a digital map and we put our coordinates of buried treasures on the map. Then
      our devious nemesis Shredder decides to mess up our map by putting a million
      fake coordinates so that we don&#39;t know were anything is anymore. It&#39;s
      hard to know what to trust anymore, and the obvious answer is that I should
      think critically about everything that I read and take it all with a grain of
      salt. But it&#39;s so tiring and waste of time to do all these things.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span
      style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em;\">Now certain things have help
      the situation:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height:
      1.6em;\">1. I would like to say a big thank you to Facebook for moving all that
      needless personal blogging to their application. Facebook has removed the need
      for most people to have a personal blog and they can just express and show their
      personal opinions about cats there.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:
      13px; line-height: 1.6em;\">2. Twitter has evolved from this micro blogging
      site to a site were people share links to great content. So it&#39;s helps the
      process to find new content.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px;
      line-height: 1.6em;\">3. Sites in the stack exchange family who are trying to
      change forums to useful Question and Answer websites were people can vote on
      which questions were valuable and which answer is the clearest. It makes my
      life as a programmer easier, but I also find their other websites to be great
      learning tools.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height:
      1.6em;\">So to the aliens that crawl the internet in the future and find this
      blog post, I apologize for all the crap that&#39;s out there, but I hope you
      know that we&#39;re trying to make it better and we&#39;re not civilization
      isn&#39;t negative as the forums make us out to be.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span
      style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em;\">On that note, I will try to keep
      my blog to a small audience until I feel that it&#39;s actually making the internet
      a better place. But if I did just waste your time, I&#39;m really sorry.</span></p>\r\n"
